    "Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game where players can freely build, explore, communicate, and form a metaverse within a virtual space. **The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence, led by Professor Frank Wood and based in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia**, launched a data collection project called plaicraft.ai on September 27, 2023. plaicraft.ai focuses on collecting players' behaviour, such as gameplay, speech, and key presses, to train AI that can react not only to text messages but also to complex situations surrounding them.\n",

    "To contribute to the research project, we have chosen one of the three broad questions provided to us: **\"We would like to know which 'kinds' of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\"** This question is vital for scientists to ask, as marketing this project to the targeted audience can increase both the efficiency of recruiting efforts and the quality of the data collected. \n",

    "We have found that the model accurately predicts whether the player is subscribed with approximately 71.43% accuracy. For a dataset like this, it is a reasonable value, but it is too low for one that could have serious consequences if it predicts incorrectly. This accuracy estimate may not be accurate due to the significant difference between the number of subscribers and the number of non-subscribers. The closest points to the point we want to predict are often subscribed rather than unsubscribed, because there are many more subscribed players than non-subscribed players in the dataset. We had expected the classifier to be neither very strong nor very weak, so this is similar to what we expected. We can correctly answer our predictive question if we build the classifier on a larger training set that has roughly equal numbers of each of the possible categories we want to predict. This can absolutely lead to further questions, such as whether other predictors would be more useful than age and total played hours, and whether there is a definite correlation between subscription and any of our predictors."
