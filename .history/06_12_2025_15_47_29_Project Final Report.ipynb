    "Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game where players can freely build, explore, communicate, and form a metaverse within a virtual space. **The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence, led by Professor Frank Wood and based in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia**, launched a data collection project called plaicraft.ai on September 27, 2023. plaicraft.ai focuses on collecting players' behaviour, such as gameplay, speech, and key presses, to train AI that can react not only to text messages but also to complex situations surrounding them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To contribute to the research project, we have chosen one of the three broad questions provided to us: **\"We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\"** This question is vital for scientists to ask, as marketing this project to the targeted audience can increase both the efficiency of recruiting efforts and the quality of the data collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our DSCI 100 project, we have formulated the specific predictive question: **\"Can a player's total played hours and age predict if they are subscribed to a game-related newsletter?\"** We will answer our target question using one of the datasets provided to us: player.csv.\n"

    "To address our question, we will use **KNN classification** with nearest neighbours to predict a player's subscription status based on total hours spent on the server and age. To apply this method, we will assume that the player's age was reported honestly and accurately. Potential limitations include insufficient data points to make accurate predictions and an uneven distribution of subscribed and unsubscribed players. We will split the data into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%), then use 5-fold cross-validation to find the best number of nearest neighbours and evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set."
